成品未出，repo 先行。

这是我学习 [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) 的实练项目，豆瓣客户端（广播 + 电影）。

# Install

To run Watched on your own device, you should follow the steps:

0. You should have a Mac with Xcode installed. 
1. Watched is built with [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native), therefore, you need RN installed. Follow the official [Get Started](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content) page.
2. Clone the repo and go to `Watched` folder. 
3. Run `npm install react-native` and then `npm install`, to keep `node_modules` folder ordered. 
4. You may need to re-link the libraries that Watched uses in Xcode and follow the steps [described here](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios.html); You may also need to spend a little happy time adjusting the node modules... (quite a lot for me :/)
